			<p>When CDs first came out, Cd players were very expensive. The idea of kids having a whole collection of CDs was unthinkable. When the first portable CD
			players came out, they were not for jogging, and could not handle the movement, they were just slightly less expensive than normal CD players due to their
			smaller size.<p>
			<break>
			<p>Eventually as CDs became more popular, and more CD players sold, the players became afforadable. Sony were the spearhead of CD players, but especially of
			portable CD players. They innovated around the problem of motion causing skipping until they came out with the Walkman, which allows a listener to 
			walk or jog while listening to the CD.<p>
